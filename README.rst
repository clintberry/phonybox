Plivo-in-a-Box
==============

Plivo-in-a-box (PIAB) is a full phone system already installed with FreeSWITCH and Plivo. Fire it up, and you have a working phone system that you can customize with PHP.


PIAB is based on a custom Vagrant box that I have built, which is essentially just a virtual machine pre-installed and configured with FreeSWITCH, Plivo, PHP/Apache, and MySQL. 
It is a great starting point to get your next phone app started quickly. REALLY QUICKLY. I mean no installation of anything, just fire it up and it works...


Installation
------------

1. Install VirtualBox - a cross platform virtual machine program by Oracle

2. Install Vagrant - a virtual machine provisioner making it easier than ever to automate virtual machine setups

3. Check out the code...

4. In your terminal, go to the code directory and type: vagrant up (FYI - on first usage this downloads a rather large (1 gig) virtual machine file)

Yeah, that is it....


Usage
-----

coming soon....
